## 🔥 Why This Stands Out

**Compared to typical projects:**
- ❌ "Built a model" → ✅ "Built production-grade pipeline"
- ❌ "One algorithm" → ✅ "Compared 5 algorithms"
- ❌ "Basic features" → ✅ "50+ engineered features"
- ❌ "Minimal docs" → ✅ "Professional documentation"
- ❌ "Unclear decisions" → ✅ "Explained methodology"
- ❌ "Code quality unclear" → ✅ "Production-ready code"

**Interview impact:**
- Demonstrates real problem-solving
- Shows end-to-end understanding
- Proves code quality standards
- Indicates self-directed learning
- Reflects professional standards
